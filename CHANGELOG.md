## Unreleased

### Changed
- Merged `Directorio de funcionarios - Básico` and `Directorio de funcionarios - Completo` rules into `Directorio de servidores públicos, empleados (i.e. funcionários)`, originally created to allow more flexibility for obligated entities, because of its potential to generate confusion and discourage the compliance to the legal rule (i.e. a full directory with complete information).
