# How to contribute

We are grateful that you would like to help improve this project. The best way to do this is to create a message in the "problems" session in the [official Github repository] (https://github.com/Dejusticia/mota-active-transparency-specification/). That way, it facilitates your contribution and it helps all users. If you have experience contributing to open source projects, you can fork the official repository, edit the files in the develop branch, and then send a pull request.

Another way is to send a message to cbessa (at) dejusticia dot org. However, due to the volume of messages, we cannot guarantee quick responses. For this reason, we recommend sending messages in the repository, as it ensures that your messages are read by all members of the project development team and other users who can respond more quickly and collaboratively.

Please be clear, concise and civilized. We do prefer [spanish](CONTRIBUYENDO.md), but you may use english and [portuguese](CONTRIBUINDO.md) as well.

** Please, always make your change in the develop branch **
