## Introduction
[This document (in spanish)](mota-active-transparency-specification.md) specifies the criteria, legal obligations, terms and good practices for the publication and dissemination of information about transparency on the web in a easier and more useful way by governmental entities Colombia. It also offers an overview of the objectives and philosophy of the MOTA - Monitoring of Active transparency Obligations - initiative, which seeks to encourage compliance with accountability as means of fighting corruption in Colombia: the transparency of the information in open and standard  formats, easily readable by machines on the websites of the obliged subjects according to the 9, 10 and 11 articles of Colombian Law 1712 of 2014), and the clarity of the decision-making processes of such entities.

In fact, this specification is used by other components of the initiative, such as the evaluator of governmental sites robot, which in turn feeds a database with the results of evaluation, the webapp for evaluation of government websites and a library of resources ( code examples, design patterns, text templates, etc.). Interdisciplinary - covering legislation, technology, design, drafting, information science, among others - this specification is built on other specifications, patterns, laws and other sets of good practices, including [HTML5](https://w3c.github.io/html/), [WCAG 2.1](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/21/guidelines/) [wai-aria-1.2](https://w3c.github.io/aria/), [schema.org](https://schema.org), [JSON-LD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD) and, as a continuing work in progress, is subject to changes, refinements and extensions. Although the main principles and criteria are well defined, secondary criteria, special cases and specific implementations are not yet properly written or should be defined in other documents.
